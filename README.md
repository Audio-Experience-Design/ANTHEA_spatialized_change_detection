# ANTHEA spatialized change detection
Here you can find the repository linked to our paper from the ANTHEA project: 

<b>Assessing Behavioral and Neural Correlates of Change Detection in Spatialized Acoustic Scenes</b>
<br><i> Drew Cappotto, Katarina C. Poole, Vincent Martin, Martha Shiell, Maria Chait, Lorenzo Picinali</i>

This repository contains:
1. Our stimuli and code to generate binaural version of the spatialised stimuli in the folder named 'binaural_stimuli_generator'
2. The behavioural data set in the folder 'behavioural_data' split by experiment
3. The processed EEG data in the folder 'EEG_data'
