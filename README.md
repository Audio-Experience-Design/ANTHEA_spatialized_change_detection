This repository contains:
1. Our stimuli and code to generate binaural version of the spatialised stimuli in the folder named 'binaural_stimuli_generator'
2. The behavioural data set in the folder 'behavioural_data' split by experiment
3. The processed EEG data in the folder 'eeg_data' split by subject
